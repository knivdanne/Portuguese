Indicativo Pretérito Mais-que-Perfeito - a non-compound version of the present perfect, that is, the pluperfect tense. Here’s our main verb in the pluperfect tense:

the past perfect used in the sentence from past perfect can be replaced with the pluperfect without any change in the time-flow quality:

dormir (pluperfect)
A Raquel dormira bem na noite anterior.
Raquel had slept well the night before. 

vs in composto that is
ter (imperfect) → dormir (past participle)
A Raquel tinha dormido bem na noite anterior.
Raquel had slept well the previous night. 

So instead of had slept well the previous night it's now slept well the night before? But same same?

Now, I must conclude by saying that there is a difference in style between the two – the pluperfect is far more formal and mostly used in written language.
