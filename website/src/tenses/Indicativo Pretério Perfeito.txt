Indicativo Pretério Perfeito - Equivalent to Past Simple, used to talk about finished actions in the past
E.G. for ser it could be.
Ontem, fomos ao cinema = Yesterday, we went to the cinema
A semana passada foi o aniversário do Miguel  = Last week, it was Miguel's anniversary

In both examples above used adverbs of time, like yesterday and last week.

Anteontem (the day before yesterday)
Há uma semana, Há dois anos, há muito tempo (one week ago, two years ago, long time ago)
O mês passado, o ano passado (last month, last year)

Sometimes you do not have the time expressions in a sentence:
Nós arrumamos tudo e saímos mais cedo de casa = We packed up and left the house early
Você comprou este sapato na loja de Maria? = Did you buy this shoe at Maria's store

We use the preterite to talk about past actions that are completed and well delimited in time: 
A Raquel dormiu até às 10 da manhã.
Raquel slept until 10 in the morning.
As you can see above, the preterite (dormiu) translates to the past simple (slept) in English.

Note that we also use the preterite in situations where, in English, we use the present perfect:
A Raquel dormiu bem.
Raquel has slept well. (uhm, but in english I would just say Raquel slept well..)

Exercise to practice this:
you can write about how your last trip was.
