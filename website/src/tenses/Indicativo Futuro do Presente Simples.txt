It is worth noticing that the Portuguese equivalent of the simple future tense has a conjugation pattern that encompasses almost all verbs (three exceptions only). 
To conjugate the Portuguese simple future tense, take the infinitive form of any verb (that will make the stem) and add the ending to it. It’s as simple as that.
The three exceptions (the endings are the same but the stem doesn’t correspond to the infinitive form):
Fazer becomes far, dizer becomes dir, trazer becomes trar

Examples:
Pensarei nisso e digo-te algo mais tarde.
I will think about that and I’ll get back to you later on.

Now, this futuro tense will often sound too formal and is mostly used in written language. 
In day-to-day life, we are likely to use something more colloquial and akin to the English structure be going to + main verb.

Vou pensar nisso e digo-te algo mais tarde.
I will think about that and I’ll get back to you later on.

Note that, in English, the difference between will + infinitive vs. be going to + infinitive is overly contextual (and not so much pertaining to differences in style). 

In Portuguese, however, the difference between futuro vs. ir + infinitive mostly concerns style and register (formal/written vs. informal/spoken).

Finally, we sometimes use futuro to wonder about something (uncertain scenario): 

pensar (futuro)
O Edgar pensará que estou chateado com ele… 
Edgar might be thinking I am cross with him…
In this context, another alternative (perhaps more common) would be to use the Portuguese modal* verb dever:

dever (presente) > pensar (infinitivo)
O Edgar deve pensar que estou chateado com ele… 
Edgar might be thinking I am cross with him…
